# rustris
This is a very basic tui version of tetris written in rust. It was more of a project to learn more rust than to be a complete tetris version. The graphics are based on the original tetris.

## compatibility
This uses termion for keyboard input and writing to the terminal. It should work with mac and linux but probably won't work with windows.

## TODO:
add a start end and pause screen
